# workThroughRustInAction
Just a public repo where I work through RustInAction chapter by chapter. [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/hawkBaby/workThroughRustInAction)](https://repl.it/github/hawkBaby/workThroughRustInAction) 

This repo is intended as a place to store my code as I work through the book. It is not intended as a teaching guide or as useful to anyone but myself. If you're interested in learning more - please check out T.S McNamara's work at Manning Publications.
